                  <p class="font-16 mt-10 mb-10">Being bullied can leave you feeling helpless, humiliated, depressed, or even suicidal. But there are ways to protect yourself or your child—at school and online—and deal with a bully.</p>
				  <h3 class="font-20">What is bullying?</h3><p class="font-16 mt-10 mb-10">Bullying is repeated aggressive behavior that can be physical, verbal, or relational, in-person or online. Bullies are often relentless, bullying over and over again for long periods of time. You may live in constant fear of where and when the bully will strike next, what they’ll do, and how far they’ll go.<br><i>Physical bullying</i> – includes hitting, kicking, or pushing you (or even just threatening to do so), as well as stealing, hiding, or ruining your things, and hazing, harassment, or humiliation.<br><i>Verbal bullying</i> – includes name-calling, teasing, taunting, insulting, or otherwise verbally abusing you.<br><i>Relationship bullying</i> – includes refusing to talk to you, excluding you from groups or activities, spreading lies or rumors about you, making you do things you don’t want to do.<br>Boys frequently bully using physical threats and actions, while girls are more likely to engage in verbal or relationship bullying. But no type of bullying should ever be tolerated.</p>
				  <h3 class="font-20">What is cyberbullying?</h3><p class="font-16 mt-10 mb-10">Technology means that bullying is no longer limited to schoolyards or street corners. Cyberbullying can occur anywhere, even at home, via smartphones, emails, texts, and social media, 24 hours a day, with potentially hundreds of people involved. Cyberbullies use digital technology to harass, threaten, or humiliate you. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying doesn’t require face-to-face contact and isn’t limited to just a handful of witnesses at a time. It also doesn’t require physical power or strength in number. <br><b>Cyberbullies come in all shapes and sizes</b> almost anyone with an Internet connection or mobile phone can cyberbully someone else, often without having to reveal their true identity. <br><b>Cyberbullies can torment you 24 hours a day</b>, seven days a week, and the bullying can follow you anywhere so that no place, not even home, ever feels safe. And with a few clicks the humiliation can be witnessed by hundreds or even thousands of people online. <br>The methods kids and teens use to cyberbully can be as varied and imaginative as the technology they have access to. they might range from sending threatening or taunting messages via email, text, social media, or IM, to breaking into your email account or stealing your online identity to hurt and humiliate you. Some cyberbullies may even create a website or social media page to target you.<br>As with face-to-face bullying, both boys and girls cyberbully, but tend to do so in different ways. Boys tend to bully by “sexting” (sending messages of a sexual nature) or with messages that threaten physical harm. Girls, on the other hand, more commonly cyberbully by spreading lies and rumors, exposing your secrets, or by excluding you from social media groups, emails, buddy lists and the like. Because cyberbullying is so easy to perpetrate, a child or teen can easily change roles, going from cyberbullying victim at one point to cyberbully the next, and then back again.</p>
				  <h3 class="font-20">The effects of bullying and cyberbullying</h3><p class="font-16 mt-10 mb-10">Whether you’re being targeted by bullies or cyberbullies, the results are similar:<br><b>You’re made to feel hurt</b>, angry, afraid, helpless, hopeless, isolated, ashamed, and even guilty that the bullying is somehow your fault. You may even feel suicidal.<br><b>Your physical health is likely to suffer</b>, and you are at a greater risk of developing mental health problems such as depression, low self-esteem, anxiety, or adult onset PTSD.<br><b>You’re more likely to miss, skip, or drop out of school</b> to avoid being bullied.In many cases, cyberbullying can be even more painful than face-to-face bullying because:<br><b>Cyberbullying can happen anywhere, at any time</b>. You may experience it even in places where you’d normally feel safe, such as your home, and at times when you’d least expect it, like during the weekend in the company of your family. It can seem like there’s no escape from the taunting and humiliation.<br><b>A lot of cyberbullying can be done anonymously</b>, so you may not be sure who is targeting you. This can make you feel even more threatened and can embolden bullies, as they believe online anonymity means they’re less likely to get caught. Since cyberbullies can’t see your reaction, they will often go much further in their harassment or ridicule than they would if they were face-to-face with you.<br><b>Cyberbullying can be witnessed by potentially thousands of people</b>. Emails can be forwarded to many, many people while social media posts or website comments can often be seen by anyone. The more far-reaching the bullying, the more humiliating it can become.</p>
				  <h3 class="font-20">Why am I being bullied?</h3><p class="font-16 mt-10 mb-10">While there are many reasons why bullies may be targeting you, bullies tend to pick on people who are “different” or don’t fit in with the mainstream. While your individualism is something that you will celebrate later in life, it can seem like a curse when you’re young and trying to fit in. Perhaps you dress or act differently, or maybe your race, religion, or sexual orientation sets you apart. It may simply be that you’re new to the school or neighborhood and haven’t made friends yet.Other reasons why kids bully:<br>•	To make themselves popular or to gain attention.<br>•	Because they’re jealous of you.<br>•	To look tough or feel powerful.<br>•	Because they’re being bullied themselves.<br>•	To escape their own problems.<br>Whatever the reasons for you being targeted, it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. Many of us have been bullied at some point in our lives. In fact, about 25 percent of kids experience bullying, and as many as one third of teenagers suffer from cyberbullying at some point. But you don’t have to put up with it. There are plenty of people who can help you overcome the problem, retain your dignity, and preserve your sense of self.
